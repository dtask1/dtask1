- 👋 Hi, I’m @dtask1 aka Darya Task
- 👀 I’m interested in invertebrate neurobiology. I worked on Drosophila (fly) and Anopheles (mosquito) neurogenetics for my PhD, and am currently studying Uloborus (spider) web weaving for my postdoc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to track spider web-building behavior!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on genetic tools in non-model organisms, behavioral neuroscience/behavior analysis, neuroparasitism, neurodevelopment, predator/prey interactions, neuroethology and evolutionary neurobiology. I have lots of different interests!
- 📫 How to reach me: dtask1@jh.edu
